        <h2>About Ric</h2>
        <p>
          Ric’s first public performance as a singer was at age six at sleep
          away camp for which he received a prolonged standing ovation and a
          then-whopping $20 tip for his medley of Al Jolson tunes, his first
          co-musical hero, along with Ray Charles, The Shirelles, Fats Domino,
          Mose Allison and Dave Van Ronk. (Some years later I introduced him to
          bebop jazz; he would eventually run a jazz club and produce many of
          the greats in concert.) Due to inner shyness defeating outward
          bravado, Ric basically retired from singing until the age of seventeen
          at which point singing, playing, writing and performing again took
          center stage as his passion, which has continued unabated to the
          present day. As a musician, he has been acclaimed as a virtuoso on the
          recorders and wood flutes. Ric also plays piano, percussion, various
          woodwinds and other instruments, a few not so well. (Let’s be honest,
          he was a god-awful violinist until giving it up, finally taking pity
          on his listeners) As a semi-adult, Ric performed worldwide (Europe,
          the Middle East, Asia, the Caribbean and North America) before crowds
          as small as three and as large as 10,000. That one featured a howling
          dog accompanying his flute solo, the main (ok, only) reason he was
          included on the bill. He was invited by the Cuban government to
          perform his original compositions all over the island of Cuba, which
          he spent one month doing- -singing and playing with many of Cuba’s
          finest musicians. At this point in his career as a performer, while
          Ric still plays the 88s and winds, he prefers to mostly sing for his
          supper. Although a folk/rock/blueser at heart, Ric has become more of
          a world and jazz vocalist over the last several years. He has had
          eleven plays produced for which he musical directed, wrote the music
          and sometimes the lyrics. These included collaborations with Sam
          Shepard, Howard Koch (co-screenwriter of Casablanca), Shakespeare and
          Chekov (the latter two without their knowledge or approval). Ric has
          had three albums released on Imagine Records. The first, (vinyl),
          KISSING BOOTH, received the highest rating and acclaim in a review in
          the New York Daily News; the second, (CD), MY MIND TOOK OFF WITHOUT
          ME, dealt with the inner voices which inhabit Ric’s psyche, and the
          last (DVD), ALL OF ME (ALMOST) is a visual compilation culled from a
          number of Ric’s concerts. His song/video, Bless Their Souls: Vote
          Hope, garnered more than 122,000 views on Youtube and was used in the
          successful 2021 Senate runoff campaigns for Jon Ossoff and Raphael
          Warnock. They wrote: “Thanks for creating the soundtrack for our path
          to victory.”RIC
